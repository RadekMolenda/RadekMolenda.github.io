# Playing Swarm Simulator using a BOT

Hey! Check out this page [https://swarmsim.github.io/#/](https://swarmsim.github.io/#/) I love it, Let's write a BOT to play this amazing `game` for us. Here is what we are going to use:

* [Phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/download.html)
* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
* BOT (we will write one below)
  * and we will do it with a little help of [HashNuke/hound](https://github.com/HashNuke/hound)
  
Phantomjs is good choice as it's headless and we will put it on the server someday.

Elixir is the best choice as I just decided to learn this amazing language.

I won't go through all the setup now as it seems boring and quite redundant. Here is a starting point of this great (I hope) adventure: [Github commit](https://github.com/RadekMolenda/SwarmSimulatorBOT/tree/667d0e07891f3f524060380fcddd7c03f88eb721)
